            When I started to design this website, I knew I wanted a simple, and
            easy to navigate design for the user. The first part of the design
            consists of picking a layout to work with. I thought a top
            navigation bar, displaying a banner image underneath, with my
            content below the banner image was a design that would be easy for
            the user to experience. The colors I selected are very patriotic and
            goes with the theme of my content. The cream, red, and dark blue all
            contrast very well with each other, making content easy to read.
          </p>
          <p>
            The navigation I created is very user friendly, and easy to
            navigate. I wanted to make certain the user knew where they could go
            and where they are on my website. When the user hovers over a link
            in the navigation, the link turns blue with an underline decoration.
            Also, whatever page the user is on, the link stays blue with a white
            underline text decoration. This is so the user knows where they are
            and knows where they can navigate to. My navigation is also global,
            thus allowing the user to access any page they want, whenever they
            want.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created my website, so it uses repetition. The global navigation
            is the same on every page, and for all my content pages the layout
            is the same. I have made the right and left margins the same for
            every page. I also made certain to be repetitive with padding, font
            family, size, and color. My headers and content are left aligned for
            an easy-to-read experience. The text also spans across the page 65%,
            so the user does not have to read across the entire page. Reading
            text across the entire width of the page is usually difficult for
            the eyes. My repetitive design ensures the user that they easily
            know they are on the same website, no matter what page they are on.
            Since some of my content requires vertical scrolling, I included a
            “Back to top” button so the user can easily get back to the top of
            the page and go to another page.
          </p>
          <p>
            My content is organized, structured, and exciting so that the user
            has the best experience. I created catchy captions for each header,
            to make the reader want to dive right in. My content is exciting to
            read and is free of any grammar or spelling errors. I have included
            a map on my homepage, displaying the locations I have suggested to
            visit in Washington D.C. This gives the user a sense of where the
            locations exactly are relative to their possible location. My banner
            images have an image directly relating to my content, with a header
            within the banner image so they easily knows where they are on my
            website. My images also are appealing and relate to my content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional pages I have included are an about, contact, and
            reference page. I included an about page to give the user a little
            background on my passion and expertise for my website. The contact
            page displays my phone number and email for easy access to contact
            me. If you click on the email, it will conveniently open the mail
            app. My reference page has all my references listed in APA format.
            My additional pages all include the same repetitive layout, except
            for the reference page not including images since it is irrelevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            To conclude, my site has excellent design techniques which follow
            the CRAP principles of design. I ensured that my content was
            interesting and appealing to the user, while being easy to navigate
            so the user has a great experience. My webpage maintains a
            repetitive layout, so the user knows they are on my website, and
            they do not get lost. Thus, my layout, design, and content allows
            the user have an exciting experience on my website.
